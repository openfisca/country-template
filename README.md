# OpenFisca Country-Template

This repository helps you quickly set up and use your own OpenFisca country package.

**You should NOT fork it** but follow the set up instructions below.

> Otherwise, you will have to clean up all tags when you deploy your own country package.

## Setting up your Country Package

This set of instructions **only needs to be followed once** and will create your own copy of this boilerplate directory, customising it to the country you want to work on. You will need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed.

### Using GitHub (recommended for GitHub users)

1. Click on the [“Use this template” dropdown and select “Create a new repository”](https://github.com/new?template_name=country-template&template_owner=openfisca).

2. Set the repository name to `openfisca-<your_country_name>`; use underscore `_` as separator if there are spaces in the country name. For example, `openfisca-new_zealand` or `openfisca-france`.

3. After being redirected to your newly created repository, please allow a few minutes for the automatic setup to be executed. Once done, the title of the README file should be updated to `OpenFisca <your_country_name>`. 

> If the automatic setup does not start within a few minutes, you can initiate it manually:
> - Navigate to the “Actions” tab.
> - Select the “First time setup” workflow.
> - Click on “Run workflow” to start the setup process manually.

4. Follow the instructions in the new repository's README.md.

### Manual setup (recommended for users of other Git hosts)

1. [Download a copy](https://github.com/openfisca/country-template/archive/master.zip) of this repository, unzip it and `cd` into it in a Terminal window.

2. Create a new repository on your favourite git host (Bitbucket, GitLab, …) with the name `openfisca-<your_country_name>`. For example, `openfisca-new_zealand` or `openfisca-france`.

3. Execute the `first-time-setup.sh` script to initialise the git repository. This performs numerous tasks including replacing all references to `openfisca-country_template` with references to the new country package.
   - To execute the script run `bash first-time-setup.sh` from the command line
   - After the `first-time-setup.sh` has run both it and these instructions are removed.

4. Follow the instructions in the new repository's `README.md.`

## Writing the Legislation

The country whose law is modelled here has a very simple tax and benefit system.

- It has a flat rate tax whose rates increase every year.
- On the first of December, 2015, it introduced a basic income for all its citizens of age who have no income.
- On the first of December, 2016, it removed the income condition, providing all its adult citizens with a basic income.

These elements are described in different folders. All the modelling happens within the `openfisca_country_template` folder.

- The rates are in the `parameters` folder.
- The formulas are in the `variables` folder.
- This country package comes also with *reforms* in the `reforms` folder. This is optional: your country may exist without defining any reform.
    - In this country, there is [a reform project](./openfisca_country_template/reforms/modify_social_security_taxation.py) aiming to modify the social security taxation, deleting the first bracket, raising the intermediary ones and adding a new bracket with a higher tax rate of `40 %` for people earning more than `40000`. This reform project would apply starting from `2017-01-01`.

The files that are outside from the `openfisca_country_template` folder are used to set up the development environment.

## Packaging your Country Package for Distribution

Country packages are Python distributions. You can choose to distribute your package automatically via the predefined continuous deployment system on GitHub Actions, or manually.

### Automatic continuous deployment on GitHub

This repository is configured with a continuous deployment system to automate the distribution of your package via `pip`.

#### Setting up continuous deployment

To activate the continuous deployment:

1. Create an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) if you don't already have one.
2. Generate a token in your PyPI account. This token will allow GitHub Actions to securely upload new versions of your package to PyPI.
3. Add this token to your GitHub repository's secrets under the name `PYPI_TOKEN`.

Once set up, changes to the `main` branch will trigger an automated workflow to build and publish your package to PyPI, making it available for `pip` installation.

### Manual distribution

If you prefer to manually manage the release and distribution of your package, follow the guidelines provided by the [Python Packaging Authority](https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.io/tutorials/distributing-packages/#packaging-your-project).

This involves detailed steps on preparing your package, creating distribution files, and uploading them to PyPI.


## Install Instructions for Users and Contributors

This package requires [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/). More recent versions should work, but are not tested.

All platforms that can execute Python are supported, which includes GNU/Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows.

### Setting-up a Virtual Environment with venv

In order to limit dependencies conflicts, we recommend using a [virtual environment](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/) with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

- A [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is a project specific environment created to suit the needs of the project you are working on.

To create a virtual environment, launch a terminal on your computer, `cd` into your directory and follow these instructions:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv # create a new virtual environment in the “.venv” folder, which will contain all dependencies
source .venv/bin/activate # activate the venv
```

You can now operate in the venv you just created.

You can deactivate that venv at any time with `deactivate`.

:tada: You are now ready to install this OpenFisca Country Package!

Two install procedures are available. Pick procedure A or B below depending on how you plan to use this Country Package.

### A. Minimal Installation (Pip Install)

Follow this installation if you wish to:
- run calculations on a large population;
- create tax & benefits simulations;
- write an extension to this legislation (e.g. city specific tax & benefits);
- serve your Country Package with the OpenFisca Web API.

For more advanced uses, head to the [Advanced Installation](#advanced-installation-git-clone).

#### Install this Country Package with Pip Install

Inside your venv, check the prerequisites:

```sh
python --version  # should print "Python 3.9.xx".

## Serve this Country Package with the OpenFisca Web API

If you are considering building a web application, you can use the packaged OpenFisca Web API with your Country Package.

To serve the Openfisca Web API locally, run:

```sh
openfisca serve --port 5000 --country-package openfisca_country_template
```

Or use the quick-start Make command:

```
make serve-local
```

To read more about the `openfisca serve` command, check out its [documentation](https://openfisca.org/doc/openfisca-python-api/openfisca_serve.html).

You can make sure that your instance of the API is working by requesting:

```sh
curl "http://localhost:5000/spec"
```

This endpoint returns the [Open API specification](https://www.openapis.org/) of your API.

:tada: This OpenFisca Country Package is now served by the OpenFisca Web API! To learn more, go to the [OpenFisca Web API documentation](https://openfisca.org/doc/openfisca-web-api/index.html).

You can test your new Web API by sending it example JSON data located in the `situation_examples` folder.

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @./openfisca_country_template/situation_examples/couple.json \
  http://localhost:5000/calculate
```
