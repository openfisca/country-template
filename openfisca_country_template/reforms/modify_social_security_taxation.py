A reform is a set of modifications to be applied to a reference tax and benefit system to carry out experiments.

        Apply reform.

        A reform always defines an `apply` method that builds the reformed tax and benefit system from the reference one.
        See https://openfisca.org/doc/coding-the-legislation/reforms.html#writing-a-reform

        Our reform modifies the `social_security_contribution` parameter, which is a scale.
        This parameter is declared in `parameters/taxes/social_security_contribution.yaml`.
